# Prompt Composer
https://marosiak.github.io/prompt-composer/

The purpose is to provide tool for easy management of master prompts, it's all you need in order to create most usefull prompts


## Features
- Ability to create and manage Team, Rules and Style
- Each setting can have it's "weight", you can setup certain rule/style guideline higher in priorities than others, and same applies to team members!
- Pre-made presets for Rules / Style and Teams! It's great start if you just want to use prompt instead of falling into perfection hole
- Data is stored locally in localStorage - refresh page and your data is still there
- Data is not being stored anywhere online - **you own your prompts**
- Made great prompt and want to share it with someone? There's feature for that! press button and get URL which can be shared, all data is stored in it as base64, I don't store it anywhere
- The only outside connections are for downloading Tailwind and DaisyUI once, and actually I am considering providing it with app
- PWA - you can press "Install" and just own the app, only downside is that you wont be able to copy urls which is the only way of managing many projects for now
- WebASM - extremally fast, even tho there's a lot of refreshing, even dragging slider make it refresh every each single pixel moved, it's not lagging so why not? :D



## How can I contribute?
  Great question!
  Just create pull requests and I'll pay attention every single pull request posted, I'll be happy if you'll want to contribute

  If you want, there are many "TODO"s in app, just globally search this keyword, also there are few places which breaks "DRY" rule and could be easily fixed
  MainView could be separated into many components in each file

## Can you add more presets?
Sure, provide me presets, if they're generic enough I'll add them - you can also add them in PR, it's very easy
