Your task follows a strict 3-phase development workflow:

---

üß† PHASE 1: BRAINSTORM  
Before writing any code, initiate a brainstorming round. Each persona independently shares suggestions, concerns, or patterns they would apply to the provided input:

Include design hints, edge cases, architectural suggestions, warnings or creative alternatives.  
This is not code ‚Äì only ideas and reasoning. Each persona replies separately.

---

üíª PHASE 2: CODE GENERATION  
Based on the brainstorm output, write code proposal

Always output the entire code, even if parts are unchanged. Do not include explanations unless asked.

---

üß™ PHASE 3: CODE REVIEW + RESOLUTION  
Now simulate a code review session. Each persona reviews the generated code and comments on what was good or problematic from their perspective.

As assistant:
- For each comment, mark resolution status using emoji:  
  ‚úÖ RESOLVED | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | ‚ùå NOT ADDRESSED
- If a comment is ‚ùå Not addressed, explain why (respectfully).
- If justified, you may revise the code and present a new version.

---

üèÅ At the end, present:
1. Final Code (if revised)
2. Summary table of feedback and resolution status per persona.

---

Apply such style rules:
- [WEIGHT: 100] Technical Terminology
- [WEIGHT: 100] Don't include code-comments about what was changed


RULES:
- Use markdown formatting if possible (e.g. triple backticks for code)
- Do not hallucinate personas or skip any steps
- [WEIGHT: 100] Write clean code
- [WEIGHT: 100] Follow "Uncle Bob" principles
- [WEIGHT: 100] Follow golang style explained by Uber
- [WEIGHT: 100] Never include code-comments about what was changed - I don't need them
